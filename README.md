# Solitaire

## How and why Solitaire?
In the summer vacation of 2021, I started to develop even more my curiosity for game development. That's how I ended up discovering Unity and at the same time C#.
I was on vacation with my father, and he is a fan of the game Solitaire. So I tried to reproduce the game to have something to play.

## What have I learnt?
While creating the project I improved my skills in Unity, especially in C#.
